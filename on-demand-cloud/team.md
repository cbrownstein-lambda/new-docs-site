**Be sure to invite only trusted persons to your team!**

Currently, the only differences between the _Admin_ and _Member_ roles are that an _Admin_ can:

* Invite others to the team.
* Remove others from the team.
* Modify payment information.
* Change the team name.

This means that a person with a _Member_ role can, for example:

* Launch instances that will incur charges.
* Terminate instances that should continue to run.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
You can’t send an invitation to an email address already associated with a Lambda Cloud account. If you try to, you’ll be presented with a message that says there is already a Lambda Cloud account associated with the email address you’re trying to send an invitation to.

1.  The person you invited to your team will receive an email letting them know that they’ve been invited to a team on Lambda Cloud.

    In that email, they should click **Join the Team**.
