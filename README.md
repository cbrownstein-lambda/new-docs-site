# Welcome to Lambda Docs!

{% hint style="info" %}
On January 1, 2024, the [prices of certain instance types](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud#pricing) will be increasing. These increases will apply to both newly launched instances and _instances already running_. These price increases will help us add more GPUs throughout 2024 to address availability concerns from the community.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
Beginning December 13, 2023, new [Lambda GPU Cloud](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) instances will launch with Ubuntu 22.04 instead of Ubuntu 20.04. Currently running instances won't be affected by this change.

Significantly, Ubuntu 22.04 includes Python 3.10, while Ubuntu 20.04 includes Python 3.8.

[See the release notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668#heading--new-features-in-22-04-lts) to learn more about the changes introduced in Ubuntu 22.04.
