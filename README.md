# Welcome to Lambda Docs!

{% hint style="info" %}
Beginning November 22, 2023, new [Lambda GPU Cloud](https://lambdalabs.com/service/gpu-cloud) instances will launch with Ubuntu 22.04 instead of Ubuntu 20.04. Currently running instances won't be affected by this change.

Significantly, Ubuntu 22.04 includes Python 3.10, while Ubuntu 22.04 includes Python 3.8.

[See the release notes](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/jammy-jellyfish-release-notes/24668#heading--new-features-in-22-04-lts) to learn more about the changes introduced in Ubuntu 22.04.
